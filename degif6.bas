'DEGIF6.BAS - No frills GIF decoder for the VGA's 320x200x256 mode.
'By Rich Geldreich 1993 (Public domain, use as you wish.)
'This version should properly decode all LZW encoded images in
'GIF image files. I've finally added GIF89a and local colormap
'support, so it more closely follows the GIF specification. It
'still doesn't support the entire GIF89a specification, but it'll
'show most GIF files fine.
'The GIF decoding speed of this program isn't great, but I'd say
'for an all QB/PDS decoder it's not bad!
'Note: This program does not stop decoding the GIF image after the
'rest of the scanlines become invisible! This happens with images
'larger than the 320x200 screen. So if the program seems to be
'just sitting there, accessing your hard disk, don't worry...
'It'll beep when it's done.
