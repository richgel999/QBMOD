# QBMOD
This is an ancient Amiga MOD player I wrote for Microsoft's QuickBASIC 4.5/PDS 7.1. Instructions are in the .BAS files. You'll need Borland's Turbo Assembler to assemble the .ASM file.

I uploaded this to local BBS's back in 1992. Placed here in github for fun. I eventually transitioned to C/assembly using Microsoft's QuickC compiler, but I still used QuickBASIC for small scrips, as a strong calculator, etc.
